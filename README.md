## ISBD Course work.

This project enables users to manage operations related to spacecraft that extract various minerals from asteroids in space. A key feature of this project is that the database schema has been normalized to the third normal form. Moreover, a significant portion of the business logic is encapsulated within SQL triggers.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the provided SQL database schema into your preferred database management system.
3. Ensure that the database is set up correctly with all tables and relationships in the third normal form.
4. Run the application and start managing spacecraft mining operations.

Database schema is designed to adhere to the third normal form for efficient data storage.
Business logic is implemented using SQL triggers for automated processing and validation.

## Usage
1. Connect to the database with your preferred SQL client.
2. Execute SQL queries to interact with the spacecraft, asteroids, minerals, and mining operations data.
3. Utilize the provided SQL triggers to automate certain processes and enforce business rules.
4. Refer to the database schema documentation for a detailed overview of the table structure and relationships.
